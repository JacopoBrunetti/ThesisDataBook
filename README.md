In this repository you will find a brief description and the files used in my Master's Thesis Project. The project is titled _Semantic Multidimensional Modeling in Monolith: handling aggregated data through ontology_.

This master project focuses on the development of a significant extension to the Monolith application. Monolith, an existing application, serves as the basis for the extension of this project. The main innovation lies in the incorporation of an Ontology-Based Data Access (OBDA) system to facilitate the seamless integration of aggregated data.

The aim is to introduce a first version of a Monolith extension based on OBDA principles. This model is designed to efficiently represent aggregated data, providing a more comprehensive and insightful perspective.

By integrating OBDA, the project aims to improve data access and manipulation within Monolith, allowing users to interact with and analyse aggregated data in a structured and intuitive way. The multidimensional model serves as a powerful framework for organising and presenting complex datasets, contributing to a more robust and user-friendly Monolith experience.

The thesis delves into the technical details of implementing this extension, highlighting the design choices, challenges and solutions employed during the development process.

It includes:
- Ontology file → Ontology.owl
- Mapping file → OntologyMappings.mappings
- Database Dump file → Database.sql
